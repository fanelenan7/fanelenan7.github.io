### About

Created with React. Initially started with Create React App, then ejected to modify the setup, specifically for adding Sass.
I'm a firm believer that we as developers should make our lives easier by leveraging CSS whenever possible (that simple yet sublime thing was taught to me by my former director of development, the amazing [Chris Casciano](https://github.com/placenamehere)).

In case you were interested in the work I did, unfortunately my current github repo is not very representative of my current skills, since all the work I've done is locked away in private repositories.

### Setup

Clone the repository. Then run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Deployment

Since it's a user page, it's deployed from the master branch. Run `npm run deploy`.
