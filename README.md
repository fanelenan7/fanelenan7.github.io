# fanelenan7.github.io
New personal website (2018)

Created with React. Initially started with Create React App, then ejected to modify the setup, specifically for adding Sass.
I'm a firm believer that we as developers should make our lives easier by leveraging CSS whenever possible (that simple yet sublime thing was taught to me by my former director of development, the amazing [Chris Casciano](https://github.com/placenamehere)). This particular site has like, no moving parts, so state is completely unnecessary, so yay functional components!

I tried to showcase the things I have learned over the last year or so of my professional journey, such as CSS Grid and Mobile-First design, and the progress that I have made. I was pretty amazed by all the things I used to do when I started revamping my old personal site (which was done with just html, css and jQuery), and I hope a year or so later I can do even better.

In case you were interested in the work I did, unfortunately my current github repo is not very representative of my current skills... and I can't really show you any actual code from the projects I did over the last year because it's proprietary. And even deployed projects shouldn't be out in the wide open web, for example, a project I worked on for IBM Watson Health, as it is an internal only project. Same goes for the AV&C app. Both of those were React and Redux apps with Django back-end and I have learned a lot from building them.

You can check out [Releaf App](https://releafapp.com/) though, in [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/releaf-thoughtful-approach/id1108402819) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.releafapp.releaf) (or whatever it's called these days?), in fact I encourage you to! It's a great app, and it has a very touching goal. My involvement with it was limited, but I am proud to say I have contributed to it.

However, I tried to show my growth in this website as much as I could. I also revisited some of my old projects, and while I didn't want to completely revamp them, as they do show my progress over time, I have redeployed them, away from gh-pages, and fixed up some stuff (like FullContact API I used in one of the projects had completely revamped the way you should be using it).

I hope you find my site tasteful and nice to use.
